👋🏽  Hi! My name is Nicole Rue! A software developer currently based in Vancouver, B.C.

🌱  My pronouns are she/her and I'm happiest when connecting, creating, and learning!

🙏🏽  I'm super grateful to be living, working, learning, and playing on the unceded Coast Salish Territories, specifically the unceded, ancestral and traditional territories of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) nations.

🧩  Mostly a front-end dev, but I also enjoy the full stack experience! Check out my full stack deployment [Morning Moodz](https://morningmoodz.com) that's currently being used by teachers across Canada and the U.S.!

🤗  Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolerue/) !
